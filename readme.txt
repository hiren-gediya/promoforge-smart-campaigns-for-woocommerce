Create powerful Flash Offers, Scheduled Offers, Special URL-based promotions, and BOGO deals inside WooCommerce with full control.

== Description ==

PromoForge Smart Campaigns for WooCommerce is a powerful and flexible promotional plugin that helps store owners create structured offer campaigns inside WooCommerce.

Create Flash Sales, Scheduled Offers, Special URL-Based Offers, and BOGO (Buy One Get One & Buy X Get Y) promotions with complete control over products, categories, discount logic, and visibility.

Designed for real-world WooCommerce stores, PromoForge ensures discounts are applied correctly on the product page, cart, and checkout — without affecting global pricing rules.

=== Key Features ===

* Flash Offers with countdown timer support  
* Upcoming Offers with scheduled start and end dates  
* Special Offers displayed via shortcode  
* BOGO Offers (Buy One Get One / Buy X Get Y with discount)  
* Category-based or product-based targeting  
* Offer-specific pricing logic (no global price override)  
* Discounts applied on:
  - Product page  
  - Cart page  
  - Checkout page  
* AJAX-powered admin interface  
* Shortcode support for flexible placement  
* Secure and optimized architecture  
* Fully compatible with WooCommerce

=== Flash Offers ===
Create limited-time promotions with automatic expiration and countdown-based logic.

=== Upcoming Offers ===

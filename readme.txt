Create powerful Flash Offers, Scheduled Offers, Special URL-based promotions, and BOGO deals inside WooCommerce with full control.

== Description ==

PromoForge Smart Campaigns for WooCommerce is a powerful WooCommerce discount plugin that lets you create structured Flash Sales, BOGO deals, scheduled offers, and special URL-based promotions — without modifying global pricing rules.

If you are looking for a WooCommerce BOGO plugin, WooCommerce flash sale plugin, or an advanced WooCommerce discount rules system, PromoForge gives you full control over products, categories, timing, and campaign visibility.

Designed for real-world WooCommerce stores, PromoForge ensures discounts are applied correctly on the product page, cart, and checkout — without affecting global pricing rules.

Unlike simple discount plugins that override global pricing, PromoForge applies campaign-based pricing logic only where required.

PromoForge is built for WooCommerce store owners who want structured promotional campaigns — not just basic discounts.

=== Key Features ===

* Flash Offers with countdown timer support  
* Upcoming Offers with scheduled start and end dates  
* Special Offers displayed via shortcode  
* BOGO Offers (Buy One Get One / Buy X Get Y discount logic)  
* Category-based or product-based targeting  
* Offer-specific pricing logic (no global price override)  
* Discounts applied on:
  - Product page  
  - Cart page  
  - Checkout page  
* AJAX-powered admin interface  
* Shortcode support for flexible placement  
* Secure and optimized architecture  
* Fully compatible with WooCommerce  

=== Offer Types ===

=== Flash Offers ===
Create limited-time promotions with automatic expiration and countdown-based logic.

=== Upcoming Offers ===
Schedule campaigns to automatically activate and expire at a future date and time.

=== Special Offers ===
Create exclusive URL-based offers and display them using shortcodes. Discounts apply only when accessed through the specific offer link.

=== BOGO Offers ===
Create Buy One Get One or Buy X Get Y campaigns with quantity-based discount rules applied directly in cart and checkout.

=== How It Works ===

1. Create an offer from the WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Select the offer type (Flash, Upcoming, Special, or BOGO).
3. Choose products or categories.
4. Define discount rules.
5. The offer applies automatically based on configured conditions.

=== Global Settings Panel ===

PromoForge includes a centralized settings panel where store owners can:

* Customize offer badge texts
* Control where badges and countdown timers are displayed
* Set BOGO badge labels
* Configure countdown display format
* Override product pricing behavior
* Customize the Thank You page savings message
* Control single product display behavior

=== Perfect For ===

* WooCommerce store owners running flash sales
* Stores offering BOGO promotions
* Marketing campaigns with limited-time discounts
* Seasonal or scheduled promotional events

=== Why Choose PromoForge? ===
